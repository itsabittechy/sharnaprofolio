    <h1>About Me</h1>
 
 <h2>Why I wanted to get into Software Engineering</h2>
 <p>I have always have love for computers but i didnt know nor understand much about them, i just knew that i wanted one. I went to college to do business and eneterprise and i was happy with it then, i went to university and studied accounting and finance, i had to drop out due to medical issues with my mum and haaving to take care of her full time. I started to work hospitality for 3 years and i met a number of people that i ama still friends with til this day. there was a particualar conversation that i had in 2019 and i said i lost my passion for accounting and i dont wnt to do it anymore but i also dont want to working in a industry that i dont want to progress in. A collegue asked what i like and i said i have always loved maths and computers but have delved into it that much as fear i would fail. the collegue said to try coding or computer science degree and see what happens. I looked into it and found so fancisnating and intreseting an started to watch people code but actually do it. In may 2021 i applied for GenerationUK data engineering course which is for people for with experience in the tech world but didnt realise that at the time, a staff at th at cohort suggested applying for the tech accelerator course in course, it is a 6 week bootcamp that teaches you the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am hoping to get an apprenticeship in software engineering to further my career path throught the tech world. </p>
