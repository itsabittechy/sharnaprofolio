    <h1>About Me</h1>

 <h2>Why I wanted to get into Software Engineering</h2>
 <img src="../pictures/Sharna.jpg"/>
 <p>I am Sharna-Ebony Brown, I am London based and have always had a love for computers but I didn't know nor understand much about them, I just knew that I wanted one. I went to college to do business and eneterprise and I was happy with it then, I went to university to study accounting and finance, I had to drop out due to medical issues with my mother and having to take care of her full time. I started to work in hospitality for 3 years and I met a number of people that I am still in contact with til this day. There was a particualar conversation that I had in 2019 and I said I lost my passion for accounting and I don't want to do it anymore but I also don't want to working in a industry that I don't want to progress in either. A collegue asked what I like and I said I have always loved maths and computers but have delved never into it that much as fear I would fail. The collegue said to try coding or computer science degree and see what happens. I looked into it and found it to be so fascinating and intreseting; I started to watch people code on YouTube but not actually do it. In may 2021 I applied for Generation UK data engineering course which is for people for with experience in the tech world but didn't realise that at the time, a staff member at that cohort suggested applying for the tech accelerator course instead, it is a 6 week bootcamp that teaches you the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am hoping to get an apprenticeship in software engineering to further my career path through the tech world.</p>
